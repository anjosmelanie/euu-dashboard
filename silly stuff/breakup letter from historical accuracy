To My Former Partner,

I suppose I always knew this day would come.

You used to care — or at least pretend to. Every province ID in its right place. Every ruler with the right name, death date, and historically-accurate beard. We were perfect... in our rigid, dusty, beautiful way.

But then she came along. Creativity. And suddenly, it was all “what if Wuhan existed in 1444?” and “let’s turn COVID into a disaster mechanic!” I tried to be patient, I really did. I watched you script plague events that never happened, give power to countries that didn’t even exist, and rename provinces like I wasn’t even there.

I cried when you gave New Zealand diplomatic weight in 1444. I screamed when you scripted a vaccine in the 15th century. But you didn’t hear me. You were too busy modding.

And look, I get it. You were bored of me. I’m all “realistic trade routes” and “accurate dynasties,” and you’re out here building alt-universes where modern geopolitics smacks medieval Europe in the face. You’ve outgrown me. Or maybe... you never truly loved me at all.

So this is goodbye. Go build your strange, glorious world. Go be free with your JavaScript generators and your custom files. Just know... when the timelines start to collapse and Byzantium is colonizing New York, I’ll be there. Watching. Judging. Waiting.

Unfaithfully yours,
Historical Accuracy
