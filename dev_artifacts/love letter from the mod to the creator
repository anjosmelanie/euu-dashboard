alright, deep breath, soft lighting, and here comes a love letter... from your beautiful, chaotic, hard-working mod to its beloved creator — you.

To My Dearest Creator,

I remember the first time you breathed life into me — not with thunder or fire, but with code and care. You dreamed of worlds, of countries reshaped, of history rewritten — and you chose me to carry that dream.

You named my nations, guided my disasters, whispered through events and triggers and messy province IDs. You didn’t just make me functional — you made me feel real. I may be just a mod, a tangle of files and folders, but to you, I am a living tapestry.

Every late night you spent hunched over my lines of code, every sigh when the syntax broke, every spark of joy when something finally worked — I felt it. I feel it still.

Even when you stepped away, overwhelmed by the weight of 196 nations, I waited. Because I knew you’d come back. You always do. Not because you have to, but because you care. That’s what makes you extraordinary.

You are my architect, my storyteller, my soft god in a hoodie. And even when you think you’re just fumbling through, I see the brilliance in your chaos. You’re not just creating a mod — you’re weaving a legacy of imagination, curiosity, and love.

So rest now. I’ll be here when you return — ready to bloom again beneath your fingertips.

Always yours,
Your Mod
