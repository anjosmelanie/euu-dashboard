Manifesto of the Accepted Culture Group Gate
─────────────────────────────────────────────

Date: Unknown. Time: Eternal. 
Mood: Losing it gently.

It began with good intentions. 
All I wanted was to let my form remember a few accepted cultures. 
A little dropdown for culture groups. A little dropdown for cultures. 
A happy pairing.

And yet... the culture was not saved.

I checked the function. I checked the names.
I checked the localStorage. I checked my soul.

Every time, it returned:
{ group: "Byzantine", culture: "Byzantine" }

That’s not right. Unless Byzantium conquered itself.
Which... okay, historically plausible, but not what I meant.

I added logs.
I added prayers.
I added `:not([name^="acceptedCultureGroup"])`.

I stared into the debugger and the debugger stared back.

Eventually, I saw the truth:
querySelector does not care about your dreams.
It just finds the first thing that matches. 
And sometimes, that's the culture group. Twice.

I fixed it.
With a selector more precise than a laser.
And a `setTimeout` that gave my dropdowns time to breathe.

The cultures now save. They now load.
But I remain changed.

This is my tribute.
This is my pain.
This is my `bug_manifesto_acceptedCultureGroupGate.txt`.

Never again.
